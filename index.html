                <h5>Resources: </h5>
                <p>
                    As discussed previously, this class has numerous
                    components that will be utilized to present the material necessary
                    for understanding the coursework, the project and collaboration aspects.
                    The main source of communication of material will be <b>SLACK</b> (if account
                    isn't made, do so <em>immediately</em>!). This is where one can reach out with the Faculty
                    as well as Team Members, and can access Lecture Material and External Links. We will also use
                    <b>CANVAS</b> as source where announcements will be made and assignments will be posted. Finally,
                    we will use <b>ZOOM</b> in the instance that the class is made remote, however, this expectation is
                    low since this class and its deliverables are expected to be <strong><em>IN-PERSON</em></strong>.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>Roles: </h5>
                <p>
                    The project is made up of <b> 10 MEMBERS</b>, where we will have
                    <b>TWO PROJECT LEADS</b> and <b> EIGHT DEVELOPERS</b>. These developers will
                    will also be split into two teams, <b>FOUR</b> who will focus on <b> TIMELINE SCHEDULING</b>
                    and <b>FOUR</b> who will be <b> PLANNING THE PROJECT</b>. Ultimately, it is necessary for 
                    <strong><em>ALL MEMBERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT</em></strong>, since this is where success
                    is determined!
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>TA:</h5>
                <p>
                    Each group is also assigned <b>1 TA</b>, who is to act like the Project Manager for the group.
                    The TA is to be the main source of information between the class and the project, and will act
                    as the primary source of guidance for the project. The TA is meant to <b>HELP YOU</b> through this
                    process, helping answer all queries, setting up tentative meetings and checking on the project's progress.
                    <strong><em>PLEASE RESPECT THE TA's REQUESTS AND ADVICE</em></strong>, as doing so ensures the greatest potential 
                    to be drawn into the project.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>Lecture and Labs:</h5>
                <p>
                    As discussed already, it is imperative for members to be able to attend
                    both <b>LECTURES AND LABS</b>. The lectures will be hosted by <b>Professor Thomas Powell</b> on
                    Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 5 to 6 pm at WLH 2001. The Labs for this class will be
                    hosted on Thursdays from 9 am to 6 pm. Although <i>attendance isn't mandatory</i>, it is great
                    practice to attend both Lectures and Labs to get the MOST of all material covered.
                </p>

                <h5>Group Meetings:</h5>
                <p>
                    It is expected for the project group to have <strong> WEEKLY MEETINGS</strong> with each 
                    other to discuss progress. These meetings are to be done with the TA, and
                    we will conduct these weekly meetups every <strong>WEDNESDAY</strong> after the Lecture (i.e. past <i>6pm</i>).
                    The TA has also iterated to us that we should conduct <strong>DAILY DISCUSSIONS</strong> for around <em>30-45 minutes</em>
                    where the group can discuss ideas and results. These meetings should ideally be <b><i>In-Person</i></b> and not as much
                    on Zoom, however, due to constraints, the first meeting was held online. <strong><em>EXPECT FURTHER MEETINGS TO BE IN PERSON</em></strong>
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>Expectations:</h5>
                <p>
                    As described earlier, the project group consists of 11 members, <b>2 PROJECT LEADS</b>, <b>8 DEVELOPERS</b> and <b><i>1 TA</i></b>. 
                    These 8 developers will be split into 2 groups as well, <b>4 FOR TIMELINE SCHEDULING</b> and <b>4 FOR PLANNING</b>. It is expected that
                    project members devote at least <strong>6 HOURS PER WEEK</strong> for the project. The project can only go so far if one person contributes,
                    so it is imperative for the maximum participation of <strong><em>ALL MEMBERS</em></strong>. Questions should be raised and addressed immediately,
                    progress is to be shared vividly, and collaboration is expected thoroughly. At the end of the day, it is an experience meant to help all of us!
                    <b><i>You will get in return whatever effort you put into this project!</i></b>
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>Project Details:</h5>
                <p>
                    In our first meeting, we discussed that the initial stage of the project is to familiarize ourselves with each other,
                    understand the expectations of the project and depend on the element of <b>TEAMWORK</b>. In further meetings, we will
                    discuss about the resources that will be utilized in the project and how it is to be delivered. We are expected to hold
                    an <b>ICEBREAKER</b> event to help ease the group members to know each other, which is to be led by the project leads.
                    The primary details of the project (what it is supposed to be) will be delivered to us on <em>Friday</em> by Professor
                    Thomas Powell, and further supplements will be provided as the course progresses. The first half is to be light, but expect
                    the second half to be devoted heavily to the project, with thorough implementation happening <strong>EVERY DAY</strong>. 
                    As mentioned earlier, it is necessary for <strong><em>COLLABORATION BY ALL MEMBERS</em></strong> for the most success of the 
                    project. We will review this project with our TA in our weekly meetings, and feedback will be given for the progress.
                    This project will encompass the entire process of Software Development: Ideation, Specification, Development and Delivery.
                    We will mimick the same pathway that is taken by Software Engineers in this industry. Again, 
                    <b><i>you will get in return whatever effort you put into this project!</i></b>
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h5>Deadlines:</h5>
                <p>
                    The primary deadline for this project is set to be around <strong>FINALS WEEK</strong> (around first week of December).
                    The project is to be completed by this timeframe. We will be presenting this project to the entire class, so <i>be ready</i>! 
                    Again, we are supposed to have <b>weekly</b> meetings with our TA on Wednesdays of each week until the Final Week, and it is expected
                    we meet up for <b>daily</b> rundowns for 30-45 minutes. Potential deadlines for each part of the project are also to be provided by
                    the TA and the Professor through the course to ensure the right progress is being conduct, so <i>be alert for these</i>. 
                    Remember, <strong><em>DO NOT WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT</em></strong>.

                    If you thought it was a long read, don't worry! I'll summarize the discussion of the meeting
                    here:

                    Our project is made of 11 members, <b class="color">2 GROUP LEADS</b>,<b class="color"> 8 DEVELOPERS</b> (who will be split into groups of two 
                    for <i class="color">SCHEDULING</i> and <i class="color">PLANNING</i>) and <b><i class="color">1 TA</i></b>. The project is to be develop in a similar fashion
                    as per real-world industry standards. It is due by <b class="color">FINALS WEEK</b>, but we are expected to have <b class="color">WEEKLY</b> meetings
                    to discuss progress and <b class="color">DAILY</b> rundowns to share ideas and results. It is important to emphasize the element of <b class="color">TEAMWORK</b>
                    as this project will not be completed with partial participation, everyone has to do their part. We are expected to give about 
                    <b class="color">6 HOURS</b> per week for the project. <b><i class="color">You will get in return whatever effort you put into this project</i></b>! For any 
                    questions, please refer to the TA or the Project Leads through email or Slack.
